ArduPilot-SensorPlatform
==========================
Based on the ArduPilot project, we created a sensor platform for off-the-shelf drones, that easily can be used by people with only sparse coding skills.

The project has been based on the following community contributed repositories:
https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot

https://github.com/PX4/Firmware

https://github.com/DroidPlanner/Tower

https://github.com/ne0fhyk/3DRServices

For convenience, the Tower and 3DRServices has been merged into a single project in this repository. The additions to the Android code have been made in Android Studio 1.2 (https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/download/studio/stable).
